## Problem Domain Description
The problem domain of focus is a University Friend Making System that mainly revolves around connecting users based on similarities in music taste. Music plays an important role in our lives and can serve as the starting point of new friendships. As a result, our team would like to help bring together UofT students who share the same interests in music and artists. 

## Application Description
We are thinking of developing a social application that allows users to create profiles, sync their spotify accounts, and get matched with other users who share similar music tastes. The application will also incorporate additional features, such as chatting, following, and playing mini music trivia games with other users.

The type of users of the application is restricted to UofT students, which will involve a layer of user authentication.
