## Problem Domain Description
The problem domain of focus is a Friend Making System for students in university. Forming new friendships can be a challenging aspect of university, especially for commuter students. As a result, our team would like to help bring together UofT students who share similar interests, hobbies, and lifestyles via an application. 

## Application Description
We are thinking of developing an application that suggests new friendships based on the compatibility of its users' pre-existing social media profiles, such as Instagram and Spotify. The application will allow users to register new accounts or login to an existing one, sync their social media profiles, and get matched with other users who share similar online presences. The application will also incorporate additional features, such as chatting, following, and playing mini-games with other users.

The type of users of the application is restricted to UofT students, which will involve a layer of user authentication. Moreover, we plan on taking input from the users, like their programs of study and the colleges they are in, to find more commonalities and create the best matches. 

We can use the Instagram API and Spotify API to retrieve information about a users' profile and media. Another approach could be to use an NLP API to analyze social media biographies and captions in order to look for similarities between users.

## Technical Problems
We were not able to run the ChatGPT API successfully because we had to pay in order to obtain the token.
